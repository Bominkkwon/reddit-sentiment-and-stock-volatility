Then shut the fuck up. , It\\'s funny because I don\\'t have anything against CLOV or anything I just feel like the daily popular ticker thread exists for a reason and that we should respect that. , According to Refinitiv:\\n\\nHigh price - $16\\n\\nLow price - $1\\n\\nMean - $5.25 , Ahh gocha.. I can understand the feeling. Parts of it literally make you want to go fucking murder them.\\n\\n🍻🤙🏼 , Autocorrect wouldn\\'t type Shure tho 😬 , I\\'m not sure. In my job people say COB quite a bit. I think they are interchangeable really. , A lot of the investors (tards in this case) here unfortunately believe this a team thing 😂 , If the price starts dropping and people sell off which they will, then the tables will turn and they\\'ll vote and do it anyways. Besides. The vote was cancelled, so we didn\\'t vote on anything. Hence why I said the price needs to go up. The apes will only have tolerance for a price drop to a point. Especially now that WSB is fragmented and wildly all over the place with other stocks. Move money from one to the other. , Right so go to a casino not the stock market? Are you good in the head? You got better chances at the casino then OTM call options on meme stonks. The runs are always temporary. Here’s a thought, hold SPY for 10 years because you obviously can’t pick stocks if you think AMC at 39$ is undervalued. Get a hint of reality , We have a Market! , Currently. Luckily took my money and ran. , If ur on the popular ticker thread u need help or ur just here for entertainment because it’s hilarious seeing bipolar teens hitting their juuls while snacking on takis yoloing their allowance on AMC , I have a clue u dumbass. You are a speculator. Bears make money, Bulls Make money, Pigs like you always get slaughtered🤷🏽\\u200d♂️🤷🏽\\u200d♂️🤷🏽\\u200d♂️that’s just how it is. , Alright have fun w that. Just do me a favor and sell before the mania ends or it’s gonna be ugly. And to think Wall Street bets hasn’t even seen a bear market yet is even scarier. They are going to be scared shitless after a real bear market and it’s going to be a nice bust with discounted prices. , Let me talk to my people. Maybe a S PAC? , didn’t know I was talking to Cramer.'"

Because he knows that it’s an insignificant amount of cash for him, but it’s Life changing for others.\\n\\nServers have followed him out to his car, crying about how that money is going to dramatically change their lives.\\n\\nHe refuses to buy any screens for his children, because he is aware of the danger of Instagram and Facebook.\\n\\nThe list goes on and on.\\n\\nI love Chamath. Big fan here. , I am guessing he doesn\\'t care. He will just keep making spacs. Already made millions on clov , All gaps fill.. , Aren\\'t they holding a vote for ATM offering? , How much did you make on $LIGMA? , CLOV holders are legit the most loathsome fanboys on this sub. , FIRE SALE!\\n\\n\\n... No financial advice here... , $CLOV is on sale right now. I’m looking long but hope we get a nice run before 8/20 , I’d like to hear some other opinions on $CLOV , AMC/GME will never finished being talked about until shorts cover. And I’m here for all of it , I bought AAPL calls the day before y\\'all claimed it.  Now I\\'m fuk , Yes, rich people, hedge funds, and institutional investors buy into a stock like AMC, get retail excited so that retail will dump their money into it, and then the big investors sell, effectively stealing retail’s money over and over again. , AMC looks weak every day. lol , After a pump there\\'s a ... , You do realize that APPL is like an OG memestock here right,  meme stocks don\\'t always have to be \"shit\" stocks,  shit I don\\'t even consider GME as a \"shit\" stock because I think the restructuring of the company has massive potential. , Mother fucker is CLOV one of the three tickers at the top of the thread being AAPL, GME, AMC?  No?  It\\'s not?  Then take your retard ass to the daily thread because that\\'s what it\\'s there for. , GME and AMC green on the day. AAPL is the only shitty meme stock in here today. , Both those stocks made higher % gains than AAPL this year. , Media spreading fake news about WSB , I\\'m nearly 600% up on AAPL, been holding since 2014... , i noticed that..GME more than a lot of companies..F for instance, which is crazy to me..we all can thank DFV for all this. i just wish i would have got wind of him last year , Fuckin BRUTAL! So sick of this shit/week..thank God its over! , I’ve a 195 avg $GME bag, planning to reduce the avg at opening, the ride is not over.\\nBullish  , $CLOV , What do you think of INO? I\\'ve got a bunch of those (and a bunch of GMEs). , GME is worth more than AAPL because their share price is higher ^^^^/s , And I need about 15 more percents to be even thank you very much... , It’ll just be an A , 155c 7/23.  Comfort me , GME , To the Moon again , Could have been 400K + 2280. NT bulls! , Must expire all the optionz! , Clov posts are being suppressed. \\n\\nIn time you\\'ll probably regret selling. , AM dump To be expected , It means those peoples contracts are expiring worthless today unless GME pulls something insane , AMC , Affirmative , Cucks on-board. , Cum on boobs , Close of Business , Close of business, when the market closes , Ah a fellow expert gambler well don\\'t forget it\\'s not a loss until you sell and if your account is red just add cash and make it green works everytime  , Oh sorry this was directed towards AMC GME rocketeers think you\\'re referring to CLOV gang , They are?  Any idea why? , Cursed? You mean because its a dogshit company LUL , Crap.  It was up earlier.  I have been buried in work for the last three hours. , you still have cash to buy?\\n\\nwhen are you gonna run out?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nsell your house, sell your cars, sell your parents, and buy AMC , Yeah that’s true but the majority don’t. We’re growing lazier and lazier by the day nobody really goes to the movies unless it’s with a friend. The only counter argument I could say is for Disney plus making it $30 to see movies. Then yes I’d go to the movies where it’s 10-15 vs that $30 but still why pay either of those prices when I can watch it for free on the internet. The only thing Amc has going for it is the nostalgia of just getting up and going out to see a movie to get outside especially right now but once people have had their fix Amc will be forgotten unless they do something completely different out of their business model to compete with streaming services. , Always habibi , Counterpoint:\\n\\nWish , Wait till ya lose steam. And then we will see.  We both know these prices won’t last buddy. I’ll be right at the end of the day I just don’t know when but prices always go back to their fair value. You’ll be rich for a bit then you are gonna get burned buddy. But don’t listen to me , Just be real w urself. There were apes thinking there was going to be a squeeze at 65. And now apes think there’s going to be a squeeze at 39? When it was literally 9 bucks a couple months ago. It’s just common sense. I didn’t believe them then why should I believe y’all now. It’s clear as day the pumps are temporary. , Actually they aren’t printing today took a 20% loss too bad I’m up 200%. You prolly bought AMC at the top. I don’t blame you tho a bunch of degens on this page trying to convince u for their own good. , Prices only went up because out the money contracts were dirt cheap and stupid people got money on their hands and guess what they lost it all these past weeks. And now you think it’s a good time to get in when retards don’t have enough buying power you are fucked. , SAY CLOVE AGAIN, I DARE YOU, I DOUBLE DARE YOU MOTHERFUCKER, SAY CLOVE ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME , Who cares about today, AAPL is about +94,000% since IPO. They shouldn’t even be mentioned in the same sentence together. , **Ticker Added INCC**\\n\\nSpam: True\\n\\nLast Seen Market Cap: 34067950.0\\n\\nIs SPAC: False , He can get M & C on his balls , GME is high risk, almost bought it a year ago when it was $20 because I actually like the stores.  Stock price way too high to value of company now.  I think CLNE is safer long term play! , To the Moon again again , Can confirm. Just on WSB in between meetings. , When AMC was bouncing around this week i was able to sell a 40C for like $1000. Just watch your DTE, i already have my puts in place to prevent failure. , Actually BB gang too but since you didn\\'t specify I didn\\'t want certain people to get their hopes up. It\\'s God\\'s work really. , Maybe, but there are a lot others that are a much worse and still seeing growth. It’s getting shorted so much that no one believes in it anymore , Makes sense to me. , no one has proven fake shares. And even there were fake shares, a bunch of other stocks would have them as well.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nape ring leaders who got in at $2 just want you to believe that so they can cash out their 20-30 baggers.\\n\\nthey don\\'t give a shit if you lose your life savings. , I might be interested in the mom. Can I get a current pic please. Naked if you want top dollar. , What if they get a play pen like what McDonald’s has? , Non-AMP Link: [https://qz.com/2030703/investors-on-reddit-showed-their-power-stopping-a-key-amc-vote/](https://qz.com/2030703/investors-on-reddit-showed-their-power-stopping-a-key-amc-vote/)\\n\\nI\\'m a bot. [Why?](https://np.reddit.com/user/NoGoogleAMPBot/comments/lbz2sg/) | [Code](https://github.com/laurinneff/no-google-amp-bot) | [Report issues](https://github.com/laurinneff/no-google-amp-bot/issues) , Can I as a grown adult walk into a casino and put it all on black?  Yes?  Then shut the fuck up. , It\\'s funny because I don\\'t have anything against CLOV or anything I just feel like the daily popular ticker thread exists for a reason and that we should respect that. , According to Refinitiv:\\n\\nHigh price - $16\\n\\nLow price - $1\\n\\nMean - $5.25 , Ahh gocha.. I can understand the feeling. Parts of it literally make you want to go fucking murder them.\\n\\n , Autocorrect wouldn\\'t type Shure tho  , I\\'m not sure. In my job people say COB quite a bit. I think they are interchangeable really. , A lot of the investors (tards in this case) here unfortunately believe this a team thing  , If the price starts dropping and people sell off which they will, then the tables will turn and they\\'ll vote and do it anyways. Besides. The vote was cancelled, so we didn\\'t vote on anything. Hence why I said the price needs to go up. The apes will only have tolerance for a price drop to a point. Especially now that WSB is fragmented and wildly all over the place with other stocks. Move money from one to the other. , Right so go to a casino not the stock market? Are you good in the head? You got better chances at the casino then OTM call options on meme stonks. The runs are always temporary. Here’s a thought, hold SPY for 10 years because you obviously can’t pick stocks if you think AMC at 39$ is undervalued. Get a hint of reality , We have a Market! , Currently. Luckily took my money and ran. , If ur on the popular ticker thread u need help or ur just here for entertainment because it’s hilarious seeing bipolar teens hitting their juuls while snacking on takis yoloing their allowance on AMC , I have a clue u dumbass. You are a speculator. Bears make money, Bulls Make money, Pigs like you always get slaughteredthat’s just how it is. , Alright have fun w that. Just do me a favor and sell before the mania ends or it’s gonna be ugly. And to think Wall Street bets hasn’t even seen a bear market yet is even scarier. They are going to be scared shitless after a real bear market and it’s going to be a nice bust with discounted prices. , Let me talk to my people. Maybe a S PAC? , didn’t know I was talking to Cramer.'"
