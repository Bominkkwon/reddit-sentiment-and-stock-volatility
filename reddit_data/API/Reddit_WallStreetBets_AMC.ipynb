Forgot governments, it‚Äôs 300 people who control it all.\\n\\nHe argues that the only way to make REAL social change is to do so from one of these 300 seated positions. And that is his goal. This is why we see SOFI and CLOV. Look at what those businesses actually are. It‚Äôs revolutionary.\\n\\nThe guy is a billionaire who came from poverty, sharing underwear with his brother and working at Burger King.\\n\\nHe is known for leaving $20,000-50,000 tips for his dinners.\\n\\nWhy? Because he knows that it‚Äôs an insignificant amount of cash for him, but it‚Äôs Life changing for others.\\n\\nServers have followed him out to his car, crying about how that money is going to dramatically change their lives.\\n\\nHe refuses to buy any screens for his children, because he is aware of the danger of Instagram and Facebook.\\n\\nThe list goes on and on.\\n\\nI love Chamath.

No?  It\\'s not?  Then take your retard ass to the daily thread because that\\'s what it\\'s there for. , GME and AMC green on the day. AAPL is the only shitty meme stock in here today. , Both those stocks made higher % gains than AAPL this year. , Media spreading fake news about WSB , I\\'m nearly 600% up on AAPL, been holding since 2014... , i noticed that..GME more than a lot of companies..F for instance, which is crazy to me..we all can thank DFV for all this. i just wish i would have got wind of him last year , Fuckin BRUTAL!

I have been buried in work for the last three hours. , you still have cash to buy?\\n\\nwhen are you gonna run out?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nsell your house, sell your cars, sell your parents, and buy AMC , Yeah that‚Äôs true but the majority don‚Äôt. We‚Äôre growing lazier and lazier by the day nobody really goes to the movies unless it‚Äôs with a friend. The only counter argument I could say is for Disney plus making it $30 to see movies. Then yes I‚Äôd go to the movies where it‚Äôs 10-15 vs that $30 but still why pay either of those prices when I can watch it for free on the internet.

It‚Äôs clear as day the pumps are temporary. , Actually they aren‚Äôt printing today took a 20% loss too bad I‚Äôm up 200%. You prolly bought AMC at the topü§£. I don‚Äôt blame you tho a bunch of degens on this page trying to convince u for their own good. , Prices only went up because out the money contracts were dirt cheap and stupid people got money on their hands and guess what they lost it all these past weeks. And now you think it‚Äôs a good time to get in when retards don‚Äôt have enough buying power you are fucked. , SAY CLOVE AGAIN, I DARE YOU, I DOUBLE DARE YOU MOTHERFUCKER, SAY CLOVE ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME , Who cares about today, AAPL is about +94,000% since IPO.

Just watch your DTE, i already have my puts in place to prevent failure. , Actually BB gang too but since you didn\\'t specify I didn\\'t want certain people to get their hopes up. It\\'s God\\'s work really. , Maybe, but there are a lot others that are a much worse and still seeing growth.

Besides. The vote was cancelled, so we didn\\'t vote on anything. Hence why I said the price needs to go up. The apes will only have tolerance for a price drop to a point. Especially now that WSB is fragmented and wildly all over the place with other stocks. Move money from one to the other. , Right so go to a casino not the stock market? Are you good in the head? You got better chances at the casino then OTM call options on meme stonks. The runs are always temporary.

We‚Äôre growing lazier and lazier by the day nobody really goes to the movies unless it‚Äôs with a friend. The only counter argument I could say is for Disney plus making it $30 to see movies. Then yes I‚Äôd go to the movies where it‚Äôs 10-15 vs that $30 but still why pay either of those prices when I can watch it for free on the internet. The only thing Amc has going for it is the nostalgia of just getting up and going out to see a movie to get outside especially right now but once people have had their fix Amc will be forgotten unless they do something completely different out of their business model to compete with streaming services. , Always habibi , Counterpoint:\\n\\nWish , Wait till ya lose steam.

It‚Äôs clear as day the pumps are temporary. , Actually they aren‚Äôt printing today took a 20% loss too bad I‚Äôm up 200%. You prolly bought AMC at the top. I don‚Äôt blame you tho a bunch of degens on this page trying to convince u for their own good. , Prices only went up because out the money contracts were dirt cheap and stupid people got money on their hands and guess what they lost it all these past weeks. And now you think it‚Äôs a good time to get in when retards don‚Äôt have enough buying power you are fucked. , SAY CLOVE AGAIN, I DARE YOU, I DOUBLE DARE YOU MOTHERFUCKER, SAY CLOVE ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME , Who cares about today, AAPL is about +94,000% since IPO.

Just on WSB in between meetings. , When AMC was bouncing around this week i was able to sell a 40C for like $1000. Just watch your DTE, i already have my puts in place to prevent failure. , Actually BB gang too but since you didn\\'t specify I didn\\'t want certain people to get their hopes up. It\\'s God\\'s work really. , Maybe, but there are a lot others that are a much worse and still seeing growth. It‚Äôs getting shorted so much that no one believes in it anymore , Makes sense to me. , no one has proven fake shares. And even there were fake shares, a bunch of other stocks would have them as well.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nape ring leaders who got in at $2 just want you to believe that so they can cash out their 20-30 baggers.\\n\\nthey don\\'t give a shit if you lose your life savings. , I might be interested in the mom.

Yes?  Then shut the fuck up. , It\\'s funny because I don\\'t have anything against CLOV or anything I just feel like the daily popular ticker thread exists for a reason and that we should respect that. , According to Refinitiv:\\n\\nHigh price - $16\\n\\nLow price - $1\\n\\nMean - $5.25 , Ahh gocha..

I think they are interchangeable really. , A lot of the investors (tards in this case) here unfortunately believe this a team thing  , If the price starts dropping and people sell off which they will, then the tables will turn and they\\'ll vote and do it anyways. Besides. The vote was cancelled, so we didn\\'t vote on anything. Hence why I said the price needs to go up. The apes will only have tolerance for a price drop to a point. Especially now that WSB is fragmented and wildly all over the place with other stocks. Move money from one to the other. , Right so go to a casino not the stock market? Are you good in the head? You got better chances at the casino then OTM call options on meme stonks. The runs are always temporary. Here‚Äôs a thought, hold SPY for 10 years because you obviously can‚Äôt pick stocks if you think AMC at 39$ is undervalued. Get a hint of reality , We have a Market! , Currently. Luckily took my money and ran. , If ur on the popular ticker thread u need help or ur just here for entertainment because it‚Äôs hilarious seeing bipolar teens hitting their juuls while snacking on takis yoloing their allowance on AMC , I have a clue u dumbass. You are a speculator. Bears make money, Bulls Make money, Pigs like you always get slaughteredthat‚Äôs just how it is. , Alright have fun w that. Just do me a favor and sell before the mania ends or it‚Äôs gonna be ugly. And to think Wall Street bets hasn‚Äôt even seen a bear market yet is even scarier. They are going to be scared shitless after a real bear market and it‚Äôs going to be a nice bust with discounted prices. , Let me talk to my people.
