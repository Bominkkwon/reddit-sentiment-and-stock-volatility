YOU FORGOT GME RESURGENCE. , Yup , Bought it around 50 😅 , 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴 , Oh then it’s settled , I’ll settle for anything not red , Thanks , Well I expected it to get some buyers at 40 But Nope. Glad i sold at 38 instead of holding more.. bought sgoc and made my lost money back. But now every stock except mega cap is tanking. Love it , Because its not going to go up to $420, ever. But it will go up to $108-$114. Then you\\'ll be hearing all about it everywhere you turn again..and you\\'ll remember Me and this post. , i do A LOT of technical analysis..its bounced off lows 3 times in the past and the fourth time, everytime, its gone back up..now were coming off the same exact formation of 3 times bounce off..its already back up to $35 as i typed this.. now it might be a couple weeks or Hell, even into august sometime. But you should at least HOLD what you got or buy-this-dip and HOLD. And Yes, this is financial advice! , Spce going to ten dollars , And that applies to pretty much every fucking stock I own! , That\\'s really a bad attitude lol. If you want to keep the stock but think it\\'s going down, just sell now and buy back in lower. , Someone is still Holding. I have a cousin that held from $12 to $70 and is still holding now. The Youtubers got into his mind that its going to $100 plus so yes I know some people are still holding. This is not GME I wish it was for all of us but its not. , I am not trying to attack anyone. I want every investor here to make money. I am just giving my opinion as AMC is now in the mid $30s a level not seem for some time. Technical analysts would say support is broken and its a long way down back to the teens. , I upvote you both, because I’m smart. 😉 , Yeah, that\\'s what I\\'m doing now, except not a call spread, just far OTM naked calls.

The liquid capital and new contracts these guys have signed in the past 2-3 months have been insane. (As a long) ya I’m biased but I think most people can agree their numbers and earnings should justify a stock price adjustment. Pump and dump or not it should sit $7-$8 comfortably , Those are the shills and bots from people and institutions trying to sway public thought.

Probably. , Solid logic , I\\'m here in wsb so... , Don’t drop the bag , Okay Calls or shares? , It takes a long time to brew a big healthy fart. , Not realized yet. This will pay big , Spy and QQQ are indexes not individual stocks. They represent the stock market, which is green. Meme stocks just aren’t supposed to be at the level they’ve been at , And we know they know we know. 🚀🌕 , Lol I\\'m sure your magic meme stock will cure it. , It’s become an obvious bag maker thread.\\n\\nAMC and GME have better subs on their own, this sub is for quick plays and options. AMC And GME literally ate in a league of their own , Like I give a fuck about a few thousand dollars , I think they actually refer to you as lord tiny cock king of impotence , Thank you.\\n\\nBut you know how it goes around here.\\n\\nEveryone in their own little silos. Which is why the loss porn is do immense. , Not trying to be a dick, I got burned too , That\\'s when I triple down. , [deleted] , Yea, youre half smart, we\\'ll call it that , I ran naked for awhile, to stressful.  They really blow up with a little upward movement...  got sceered.... , They started in the 60’s zone. \\n\\nReddit amc forum has a lot of DD. , According to filings he doesn\\'t have enough to loan he sold EVERYTHING & killed the momentum , Eat dick pussy 🤫💩 , Ok qanon , Bought at 5 and didnt sell when it was above 70?

I buy clov shares everyday and now accumulated 8K+ shares, and reach 10K quite fast...i am telling myseld everyday not buying , Talked to WSB for a refund 🤔 , Sir, this is a ca… jk i agree, been in NOK for a while and not for the meme , Sounds like the best part of you ran down your daddys leg... tragic , Holding both shares and calls. , -10% already LMAO , If it will pay big then buy more at $34 , So you\\'d donate a couple thousand to total strangers? Consider me interested , [deleted] , Gtfo with your spce bs this is the popular ticker thread Branson ass eater , Not all meme stocks are the same , Clov is a new chamath spac, do some research :) , Which half?? , Yeah, you need the cash collateral and patience. My short position was caused by naked calls expiring deep ITM and I held that for 1.5 months, until today.\\n\\nI think buying them back when they \"blow up\" is not the right strategy if you have enough cash. Better to wait out the resulting short. , Problem is that the AMC forum is biased. \\n\\nI\\'m an AMC 🦧 but not an AMC Stan. , Jokes on you, my gf has both. , Touché , Hope you had a lot of shares 🚀🌕 , oh look, morons fighting over which turd they want to lose their money in , Called it , They’ll go up, eventually, def hold the shares for a little. SPCE might take longer but yes hold those. As for the calls if exp is close try and keep losses to a minimum but don’t hold until day of exp and sell worthless please. , Yeah when GME, AMC take the rest of us to tendieland I\\'ll give you 50 dollars to lick my bootyhole , [you RN](https://me.me/i/where-is-my-penis-fat-men-are-a-feminist-issue-d9ff2b06905148d788c1a50f3d1b2f06) , [deleted] , [deleted] , 👍🏻 , I did.

It goes down, i buy more. I have 8K+ shares, i will slowly build it up to 10K, 20K...and so on. Deep faith, no emotions when it is red days or green days'"

No hate, but we\\'re here to make money. , smart man , Fk your puts , Puts are what have me in the hole with AMC ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) , Lmfao I am the manager. And the owner. , Bro, IT WILL NEVER. YOU FORGOT GME RESURGENCE. , Yup , Bought it around 50  ,  , Oh then it’s settled , I’ll settle for anything not red , Thanks , Well I expected it to get some buyers at 40 But Nope. Glad i sold at 38 instead of holding more.. bought sgoc and made my lost money back. But now every stock except mega cap is tanking. Love it , Because its not going to go up to $420, ever. But it will go up to $108-$114. Then you\\'ll be hearing all about it everywhere you turn again..and you\\'ll remember Me and this post. , i do A LOT of technical analysis..its bounced off lows 3 times in the past and the fourth time, everytime, its gone back up..now were coming off the same exact formation of 3 times bounce off..its already back up to $35 as i typed this.. now it might be a couple weeks or Hell, even into august sometime. But you should at least HOLD what you got or buy-this-dip and HOLD. And Yes, this is financial advice! , Spce going to ten dollars , And that applies to pretty much every fucking stock I own! , That\\'s really a bad attitude lol. If you want to keep the stock but think it\\'s going down, just sell now and buy back in lower. , Someone is still Holding. I have a cousin that held from $12 to $70 and is still holding now. The Youtubers got into his mind that its going to $100 plus so yes I know some people are still holding. This is not GME I wish it was for all of us but its not. , I am not trying to attack anyone. I want every investor here to make money. I am just giving my opinion as AMC is now in the mid $30s a level not seem for some time. Technical analysts would say support is broken and its a long way down back to the teens. , I upvote you both, because I’m smart.  , Yeah, that\\'s what I\\'m doing now, except not a call spread, just far OTM naked calls. I have 250k cash in cash they run in the money and I end up in a short position. , I’m confident one of us will be correct , then fuck you Tom Hanks! , This high? , You should get a tattoo of a Butt, ON your Butt , My friend better delete this comment fast , Get ready to wear my wifes face on your skin , I’m hoping you’re wrong.  , \\'On Sale\\' salsa , They did a second flooding? But they already diluted 5:1 last year right? And I fully agree, I don’t understand why it was flying this high for so long. I hope lots got rich, my eggs are in the GME basket. , Exactly this & the fkn lunatics rode the CEOs dick all the way down too. , Yeah they pissed off the AMC CEO now and -33% after the vote. The CEO is probably so pissed he lent out his shares to the HF in person. , Stfu bag holder , The market is green. , More apes buying amc then selling on Fidelity. 2 buys for every 1 sell. The dark pool stuff is holding amc back.\\n\\nThey’re digging a grave of naked shorting. Naked shorting naked shorts. , [deleted] , An idiot with a bag , I’m a PhD candidate working in my uni hospital, this motherfucker is lying. Get vaccinated you actual retards , I’m not talking shit about as a stock, just the people investing in it on this sub are being toxic , It seems like the comparison was directed more towards the behavior of the stock, but I could be reading it wrong.   .... also could be a clov bot.... , HEL:NOKIA has moved +8,95% this week, bullish af. Bought some more as the ship is sailing again  , Imagine buying MORE CLOV! , Oh is that so..went from $32-$35 in 5 minutes while your precious CLOV continues to BLOW ASS..like it always does , Actually I said it was a zombie company which I think is different. It may go back up who knows, but that doesn’t change the fact it’s a poorly ran company in a dying industry. , Oo a comedian , They are dead anyone holding is losing thousands , That sort of self harm might actually warrant professional intervention. , Yes, watched Godzila vs Kong last sunday. But i have no AMC Cinemas in my country and Streaming here sucks. Cinemas in generell are still very popular for new movies here in Germany. , mf said its you guys fault for making me buy the stock , Best I can do is $30 for the contract , Earnings on a $5 stock that should be $8-$9 is very different to a $50-$60 stock. The liquid capital and new contracts these guys have signed in the past 2-3 months have been insane. (As a long) ya I’m biased but I think most people can agree their numbers and earnings should justify a stock price adjustment. Pump and dump or not it should sit $7-$8 comfortably , Those are the shills and bots from people and institutions trying to sway public thought. Remember your DD And tell everyone to fuck off. , What are the chances he will realize that , I had green this morning until I didn\\'t. , Only losses I have is all my dead kids drying on yur mums face , No chance, company blew up the float with a secondary. , They\\'ll be shit too then.\\n\\nAnd red. Probably. , Solid logic , I\\'m here in wsb so... , Don’t drop the bag , Okay Calls or shares? , It takes a long time to brew a big healthy fart. , Not realized yet. This will pay big , Spy and QQQ are indexes not individual stocks. They represent the stock market, which is green. Meme stocks just aren’t supposed to be at the level they’ve been at , And we know they know we know.  , Lol I\\'m sure your magic meme stock will cure it. , It’s become an obvious bag maker thread.\\n\\nAMC and GME have better subs on their own, this sub is for quick plays and options. AMC And GME literally ate in a league of their own , Like I give a fuck about a few thousand dollars , I think they actually refer to you as lord tiny cock king of impotence , Thank you.\\n\\nBut you know how it goes around here.\\n\\nEveryone in their own little silos. Which is why the loss porn is do immense. , Not trying to be a dick, I got burned too , That\\'s when I triple down. , [deleted] , Yea, youre half smart, we\\'ll call it that , I ran naked for awhile, to stressful.  They really blow up with a little upward movement...  got sceered.... , They started in the 60’s zone. \\n\\nReddit amc forum has a lot of DD. , According to filings he doesn\\'t have enough to loan he sold EVERYTHING & killed the momentum , Eat dick pussy  , Ok qanon , Bought at 5 and didnt sell when it was above 70? Even 60? True autist , I bought when it was $2 in 2020 and sold at $18 earlier thus year. Got back in at $5 and sold at $63 in June. , I\\'ll let somebody else have my shot who is actually high risk. , Or strong belief :) , lol ok buddy, AMC is down double digits but you’re shitting on a stock down 2%\\n\\nDelusional , True CLOV hasn’t seen light in a while but AMC dropped from an ATH of 72 and still drilling , Amc will rebrand if anything. It’s not going anywhere now ,  , Lol. Time will tell. I am so into clov nowadays, and might be reaching to a illogical state. I buy clov shares everyday and now accumulated 8K+ shares, and reach 10K quite fast...i am telling myseld everyday not buying , Talked to WSB for a refund  , Sir, this is a ca… jk i agree, been in NOK for a while and not for the meme , Sounds like the best part of you ran down your daddys leg... tragic , Holding both shares and calls. , -10% already LMAO , If it will pay big then buy more at $34 , So you\\'d donate a couple thousand to total strangers? Consider me interested , [deleted] , Gtfo with your spce bs this is the popular ticker thread Branson ass eater , Not all meme stocks are the same , Clov is a new chamath spac, do some research :) , Which half?? , Yeah, you need the cash collateral and patience. My short position was caused by naked calls expiring deep ITM and I held that for 1.5 months, until today.\\n\\nI think buying them back when they \"blow up\" is not the right strategy if you have enough cash. Better to wait out the resulting short. , Problem is that the AMC forum is biased. \\n\\nI\\'m an AMC  but not an AMC Stan. , Jokes on you, my gf has both. , Touché , Hope you had a lot of shares  , oh look, morons fighting over which turd they want to lose their money in , Called it , They’ll go up, eventually, def hold the shares for a little. SPCE might take longer but yes hold those. As for the calls if exp is close try and keep losses to a minimum but don’t hold until day of exp and sell worthless please. , Yeah when GME, AMC take the rest of us to tendieland I\\'ll give you 50 dollars to lick my bootyhole , [you RN](https://me.me/i/where-is-my-penis-fat-men-are-a-feminist-issue-d9ff2b06905148d788c1a50f3d1b2f06) , [deleted] , [deleted] ,  , I did. I love AMC but I\\'m going to wait for a bigger dip. Goodluck to you. , Shut up  , Thanks. But it bled too much so  I sold. Now watch it rocket before day\\'s end. Good luck to you guys. , [deleted] ,  ok you win. They are not , Have not had any losses. Clov is going strong , Good luck to you also , I\\'ll send you a postcard from tendietown USA when we get there brother  , [deleted] , I hold until the price is 100 as the industry that is going 5x in 3 yrs and 17% of US gdp. It goes down, i buy more. I have 8K+ shares, i will slowly build it up to 10K, 20K...and so on. Deep faith, no emotions when it is red days or green days'"
